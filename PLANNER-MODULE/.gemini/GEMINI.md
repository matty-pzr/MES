## Goal
A visual workflow editor for non-technical planners.

## Key Features
- Users create production plans by dragging and connecting operation nodes on a canvas.
- It must completely hide technical details like MQTT and ISA-95. Planners will only see simple names like "Drilling".
- Users must be able to select a specific manufacturing recipe (e.g., "Recipe A for Oak Wood") for an operation.
- The UI will have an Apple-inspired minimalist design.
- Nodes on the canvas will have visual status indicators (e.g., waiting, in progress, complete).

## Key Technology
- React Flow
